# Ball Collision Python

Ball Collision Python is a Python project that simulates the collision between balls in a two-dimensional environment. This project leverages the principles of physics to accurately calculate and visualize the motion and interaction of the balls during collisions.

## Features

- **Realistic Ball Physics:** The project implements realistic ball physics, taking into account factors such as mass, velocity, and coefficient of restitution to accurately model the behavior of the balls during collisions.
- **Real-time Visualization:** The simulation provides real-time visual feedback, enabling users to see the balls in motion and witness the collisions as they occur. The graphical representation enhances the understanding and analysis of the collision behavior.
- **Customizable Environment:** Users have the flexibility to customize the simulation environment, including the dimensions of the playing area and any constraints or boundaries that might affect the ball movement and collisions.
- **Educational Tool:** Ball Collision Python serves as an educational tool for students and enthusiasts interested in physics and computational simulations. It provides an intuitive and interactive platform to explore and gain insights into the fundamental concepts of collisions and dynamics.

## Usage

To run the Ball Collision Python simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/HenriqueAPMendes/ball-collision-python.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install numpy pygame`
3. Run the main script: `python BallCollision.py`
4. Interact with the simulation by adjusting the parameters or observing the default scenario.
5. Enjoy!
